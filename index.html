            Hello! My name is Amazan Andersen and I am from Haiti. I enjoy coding, football, and spending time at the beach. 
            I am currently studying Web Design and Development at BYU-Idaho. I am excited to learn more about web development and design. 
            I am looking forward to creating my own website and learning more about the industry. I am excited to see what the future holds for me.
